Develop wxRaven Plugins

This is where this application is supposed to shine, as without plugin, this software "only" provide an
High level API / RPC Shell and command list.

- Developers may want to have a look at the [Plugin tutorial Example](plugins/Tutorial/) 
- wxRaven itself is using its own plugins, see [General](plugins/General) and [RavenRPC](plugins/RavenRPC/)
- Some basic example are also included such as a [Simple Wallet](plugins/SimpleWallet/)

GUI is designed using [wxFormBuilder](https://github.com/wxFormBuilder/wxFormBuilder)
